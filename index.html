        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project started as an attempt to explore the emotional landscape of Bulgarian poetry, using emotion recognition languagemodels. It turned out that those models are pretty bad at recognizing emotions.  
        </p>
        <p>
        This is a poem about the death of a Bulgarian revolutionary hero who was killed by the Ottoman Empire. The faithful English translation is not great but still decent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            EmoRoberta is considered the most nuanced emotion recognition model. It still deems the text as a pretty neutral text.
